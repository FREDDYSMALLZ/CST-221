About The Author:
My name is Christopher Hyde though I go by Chris. I am currently working my way through Grand Canyon University to get my bachelor’s in computer Programming.
I have dabbled in programming on and off for a few years without ever going beyond the basics. Some of the languages I have dabbled in include C#, C++, Java, 
and Python. I'm hoping that one day I will have a job working with a team to create useful application or even video games. Though I know most programmers 
end up just maintaining another person’s program. One of my favorite things I have programmed is a command line calendar that is accurate from the first year 
of the Gregorian Calendar to the undetermined future. I put a lot of effort into making it visually appear as a calendar when printed in the command line. 
Through I have learned more about codding since then and I can refine it to be more elegant and functional, it stays unchanged as a reminder of where I was 
before coming to GCU.
